<p><em>Drafting note:</em> [basic.lval]/6 specifies that</p>
<blockquote>Whenever a glvalue appears as an operand of an operator that expects
a prvalue for that operand, the lvalue-to-rvalue (7.3.2), array-to-pointer, or
function-to-pointer (7.3.4) standard conversions are applied to convert the
expression to a prvalue. [Note 5: ...] [Note 6: ...] [Note 7: ...]</blockquote>
<p><em>Consequently, it generally suffices to insert missing language specifying
when operands shall be prvalues. There are also a number of operators for which
this has already been done. In addition, there are no changes required for
expressions that are required to be constant expressions of some integral type,
because the lvalue-to-rvalue conversion is implicit in the concept of a
<q>converted constant expression</q>.</em></p>

<p>Add a note to [conv.general]/1:</p>
<blockquote><p>[...]</p>
<p>[<em>Note 1:</em> A standard conversion sequence can be empty, i.e., it can
consist of no conversions. &mdash;<em>end note</em>]</p>
<p>A standard conversion sequence will be applied to an expression if necessary
to convert it to a required destination type.</p>
<p>[<em>Note 2:</em> [...]]</p>
<p><ins>[<em>Note 3:</em> When the required destination type is an object type
and the source expression is a glvalue of the same type, the lvalue-to-rvalue
conversion is necessary to convert the expression to the destination type, even
though the expression already has the required type.
&mdash;<em>end note</em>]</ins></p></blockquote>

<p>Insert a bullet at the beginning of [expr.arith.conv]/1:</p>
<blockquote><ul><li><ins>The lvalue-to-rvalue conversion ([conv.lval]) is
applied to each operand and the resulting prvalues are used in place of the
original operands for the remainder of this
section.</li></ul></ins></blockquote>

<p>[expr.sub] requires no changes; it already states the value category required
of each operand.</p>

<p>Edit [expr.call]/1:</p>
<blockquote>[...] For a call to a non-member function or to a static member
function, the postfix expression shall <ins>be </ins>either <del>be </del>an
lvalue that refers to a function (in which case the function-to-pointer standard
conversion (7.3.4) is suppressed on the postfix expression), or
<del>have</del><ins>a prvalue of</ins> function pointer type.</blockquote>

<p>[expr.ref] requires no changes; the requirement for the first operand of the
arrow operator to be a prvalue is implicit in the transformed version
<code>(*(E1)).E2</code>.</p>

<p>[expr.dynamic.cast], [expr.static.cast], [expr.reinterpret.cast], and
[expr.const.cast] require no changes; they explicitly state when
lvalue-to-rvalue, array-to-pointer, and function-to-pointer conversions are
performed.</p>

<p>[expr.unary.op]/1 requires no changes; it states that the operand of the
<code>*</code> operator shall be a prvalue.</p>

<p>Edit [expr.unary.op]/7:</p>
<blockquote>The operand of the unary <code>+</code> operator shall
<del>have</del><ins>be a prvalue of</ins> arithmetic, unscoped enumeration, or
pointer type and the result is the value of the argument. Integral promotion is
performed on integral or enumeration operands. [...]</blockquote>

<p>Edit [expr.unary.op]/8:</p>
<blockquote>The operand of the unary <code>-</code> operator shall
<del>have</del><ins>be a prvalue of</ins> arithmetic or unscoped enumeration
type and the result is the negative of its operand. Integral promotion is performed on integral or enumeration operands. [...]</blockquote>

<p>[expr.unary.op]/9 requires no changes; the contextual conversion to
<code>bool</code> implicitly entails any required standard conversions.</p>

<p>Edit [expr.unary.op]/10:</p>
<blockquote>The operand of the <code>~</code> operator shall
<del>have</del><ins>be a prvalue of</ins> integral or unscoped enumeration type.
Integral promotions are performed. [...]</blockquote>

<p>[expr.new] requires no changes. Dynamic array bounds are <q>implicitly
converted to <code>std::size_t</code></q>.</p>

<p>Edit [expr.delete]/1:</p>
<blockquote>[...] <del>The operand shall be of pointer to object type or of
class type. </del>If <ins>the operand is </ins>of class type, <del>the
operand</del><ins>it</ins> is contextually implicitly converted (7.3) to a
pointer to object type.<sup>67</sup> <ins>Otherwise, it shall be a prvalue of
pointer to object type. </ins>The <i>delete-expression</i> has type
<code>void</code>.</blockquote>

<p>Edit [expr.mptr.oper]/2:</p>
<blockquote>The binary operator <code>.*</code> binds its second operand, which
shall be <ins>a prvalue </ins>of type <q>pointer to member of
<code>T</code></q> to its first operand, which shall be a glvalue of class
<code>T</code> or of a class of which <code>T</code> is an unambiguous and
accessible base class. [...]</blockquote>

<p>Edit [expr.mptr.oper]/3:</p>
<blockquote>The binary operator <code>-&gt;*</code> binds its second operand,
which shall be <ins>a prvalue </ins>of type <q>pointer to member of
<code>T</code></q> to its first operand, which shall be of type <q>pointer to
<code>U</code></q> where <code>U</code> is either <code>T</code> or a class of
which <code>T</code> is an unambiguous and accessible base class. The expression
<code>E1-&gt;*E2</code> is converted into the equivalent form
<code>(*(E1)).*E2</code>.</blockquote>
<p><em>Drafting note: we do not need to say that the first operand shall be a
prvalue here, because it is implied by the use of the unary <code>*</code>
operator in the transformed version.</em></p>

<p>[expr.mul] requires no changes after the changes to [expr.arith.conv].</p>

<p>Edit [expr.add]/1:</p>
<blockquote><p>The additive operators <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> group
left-to-right. <ins>Each operand shall be a prvalue. If both operands have
arithmetic or enumeration type, </ins><del>T</del><ins>t</ins>he usual
arithmetic conversions (7.4) are performed <del>for operands of arithmetic or
enumeration type</del><ins>and the converted operands are used in place of the
original operands for the remainder of this section.</ins></p>
<p><i>additive-expression:</i><br/>[...]</p>
<p>For addition, either both operands shall have arithmetic <del>or unscoped
enumeration </del>type, or one operand shall be a pointer to a
completely-defined object type and the other shall have integral or unscoped
enumeration type.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Drafting note: we could also specify that if only one operand has
arithmetic or unscoped enumeration type, it undergoes integral promotion. This
would allow us to omit <q>or unscoped enumeration type</q> in those cases as
well.</em></p>

<p>Edit [expr.add]/2:</p>
<blockquote>For subtraction, one of the following shall hold:
<ul>
<li>both operands have arithmetic <del>or unscoped enumeration </del>type;
or</li>
<li>both operands are pointers to cv-qualified or cv-unqualified versions of the
same completely-defined object type; or</li>
<li>the left operand is a pointer to a completely-defined object type and the
right operand has integral or unscoped enumeration type.</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p>Edit [expr.shift]/1:</p>
<blockquote>[...] The operands shall be <ins>prvalues </ins>of integral or
unscoped enumeration type and integral promotions are performed.
[...]</blockquote>
<p><em>Drafting note: we could also choose to specify that performing integral
promotion implicitly performs an lvalue-to-rvalue conversion (even on types that
do not promote), in which case [expr.shift] would require no changes.</em></p>

<p>[expr.spaceship] requires no changes. p4 specifies that the usual arithmetic
conversions are performed. For p5 (concerning two operands of the same
enumeration type) the lvalue-to-rvalue conversion is implicit in the specified
conversion to the underlying type. In p6, the array-to-pointer conversion is
explicitly indicated.</p>

<p>[expr.rel] and [expr.eq] require no changes; they explicitly indicate the
lvalue-to-rvalue, array-to-pointer, and function-to-pointer conversions.</p>

<p>The bitwise binary operators require no changes, since they perform the usual
arithmetic conversions.</p>

<p>The logical binary operators require no changes, since they perform
contextual conversion to <code>bool</code>.</p>

<p>[expr.ass] requires no changes since it indicates an implicit conversion from
the right operand to the left operand's type.</p>
