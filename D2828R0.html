<h2>Copy elision in the Big 3</h2>
<p>Consider the example given in the issue report:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>struct Cat {};
struct Dog { operator Cat(); };

Dog d;
Cat c(d);</code></pre>
<p>Recent versions of Clang, GCC, and MSVC all implement copy elision, and
accept the code even if <code>Cat</code>'s move constructor is explicitly
deleted. However, each implementation has taken a different approach in order to
achieve this result. The strengths and weaknesses of each approach can help
inform CWG in the attempt to find the best possible resolution for issue
2327.</p>

<p>MSVC appears to take the simplest and most conservative possible approach:
perform overload resolution exactly as the standard currently requires, and if
the copy or move constructor of <code>Cat</code> is selected to perform the
direct-initialization, and a temporary of type <i>cv</i>&nbsp;<code>Cat</code>
would be materialized in order to bind the parameter of the constructor to the
prvalue result of calling a conversion function, then just use that prvalue to
directly construct the object being initialized instead of creating a
temporary. Since I don't have access to the MSVC source code, I can't be
exactly sure that this is what it's doing, but an examination of various cases
on which MSVC diverges from Clang and GCC showed that this rule would explain
the divergence every time.</p>

<p>Clang's approach, as explained to me by Richard Smith, involves considering
both constructors and conversion functions as candidates for the
direct-initialization. In the above example, the three candidate functions for
the initialization are therefore the copy and move constructor of
<code>Cat</code> and the conversion function in <code>Dog</code>.  In order to
call either constructor of <code>Cat</code>, a user-defined conversion (namely,
<code>Dog::operator&nbsp;Cat</code>) must be invoked on the initializer
<code>d</code>. But <code>operator&nbsp;Cat</code> itself is also a candidiate,
and it only requires a standard conversion sequence (namely the reference
binding of the implicit object parameter). Consequently, it wins the overload
resolution and is called to initialize <code>c</code>.

<p>Finally, GCC's approach, which I discovered by simply reading the source
code, has characteristics of both Clang's approach and MSVC's approach. It first
enumerates the candidate constructors as the standard currently requires, but,
when determining the overload resolution priority of a copy or move constructor
whose reference parameter would bind to the prvalue result of a conversion
operator to type <i>cv</i>&nbsp;<code>Cat</code>, that constructor is considered
to be replaced by the conversion function itself (which increases its overload
resolution priority for the reasons explained in the previous paragraph).</p>

<p>In all cases, the only relevant conversion functions are the ones with return
type exactly <i>cv</i>&nbsp;<code>Cat</code>; not a derived class, and not a
reference. That's because you can't perform copy/move elision unless the
conversion function returns a prvalue of type exactly
<i>cv</i>&nbsp;<code>Cat</code>.</p>

<h2>Known divergences</h2>
<p>In this section I discuss the known divergences between the three
implementations. Because of the conservative nature of MSVC's approach, we can
assume that it doesn't break any currently valid code (other than in possible
cases where SFINAE causes a different overload to be chosen when a previously
ill-formed construct becomes well-formed); at the same time, MSVC's approach
also never <q>improves</q> overload resolution (<i>i.e.</i> it cannot make any
currently ambiguous cases unambiguous). Therefore, I'll treat MSVC's approach as
if it's the status quo when discussing the pros and cons of the Clang and GCC
approaches.</p>

<h3>Disambiguating in favor of move constructors when multiple conversion
operators are present</h3>
<p>This is the most common type of implementation divergence noticed by Stack
Overflow users. Its most common incarnation boils down to:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>struct X {
   X(int);
   // X(X&amp;&amp;);  // implicitly declared
};

struct Y {
   operator X();
   operator int();
};

X x(Y{});</code></pre>
<p>The status quo is that this is ambiguous because the candidates
<code>X::X(int)</code> and <code>X::X(X&amp;&amp;)</code> each require a
different user-defined conversion function (<code>Y::operator&nbsp;int</code>
and <code>Y::operator&nbsp;X</code>), respectively. Clang and GCC exhibit
improved behavior in such cases: Clang by treating <code>operator X</code> as a
candidate, and GCC by replacing <code>X::X(X&amp;&amp;)</code> by
<code>operator X</code> when comparing it against <code>X::X(int)</code>.</p>

<p>In the February 2023 WG21 meeting in Issaquah, the consensus in CWG was that
code like the above ought to be well-formed,
and that an approach similar to the Clang approach should be pursued in order
to make it so. However, when the issue was discussed again at the March 3, 2023
telecon, concerns were expressed about overly ambitious revisions to the
overload resolution rules (see particularly Example 4 below). The consensus was
that the benefits to making Example 2 work are outweighed by the costs of
changing the currently mandated behavior of Example 4 to a different (but also
well-formed) behavior.</p>

<p>This divergence also arises in the context of standard library classes that
have multiple one-argument constructors:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>#include &lt;string&gt;

struct X {
   template &lt;typename T&gt;
   operator T();
};

std::string s(X{});
  // string(string&amp;&amp;)?
  // string(const char*)?
  // string(const allocator&amp;)?
  // string(initializer_list&lt;char&gt;)?
  // string(nullptr_t)?</code></pre>
<p>Here, virtually anyone but a language lawyer would expect the conversion
operator to be called to convert to <code>std::string</code>.
However, having an unconstrained conversion function template as in this
example is not a particularly compelling use case. The consensus of CWG in the
March 3, 2023 telecon was again that making this example work should not come at
the cost of changing the behavior of Example 4.</p>

<h3>Preference of conversion functions over constructors that would use a
standard conversion</h3>
<p>In the previous section we discussed some cases where the Clang/GCC approach
picks the <q>right</q> constructor/conversion&nbsp;operator pair instead of
leaving it ambiguous. However, there are also currently valid cases where the
Clang/GCC approach <em>changes</em> the behavior in possibly surprising ways: a
conversion function that is suitable for elision will be preferred over most
constructors even if the implicit conversion sequence for the constructor is a
standard conversion sequence. For example:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>struct Dog;

struct Cat {
    Cat(const Dog&amp;);
};

struct Dog {
    operator Cat();
};

Cat cat(Dog{});</code></pre>
<p>In current C++ and in MSVC, this will call the converting constructor. In
Clang/GCC, this will call <code>operator&nbsp;Cat</code> because when
<code>operator&nbsp;Cat</code> is a candidate, its implicit conversion sequence
is the binding of the implicit object parameter of type <code>Dog&amp;</code>,
while the converting constructor binds a <code>const&nbsp;Dog&amp;</code>. Per
<a href="https://eel.is/c++draft/over.ics.rank#3.2.6">[over.ics.rank]/3.2.6</a>,
the less cv-qualified reference wins. Note that if the constructor and the
conversion operator cannot be distinguished by their implicit conversion
sequences, such as if <code>operator&nbsp;Cat</code> above were made
const-qualified, both Clang and GCC have a tie-breaker rule that prefers the
constructor.</p>

<p>GCC and Clang have been doing this for a long time:</p>
<ul>
<li>GCC chooses the conversion function over the constructor since version 7.1
as long as the language mode is set to C++17 or higher. (Version 7.1, released
in 2017, is the first version that is reported to support P0135.) See commit
<code>36cbfd</code>, which predates the implementation of GCC's current strategy
of tweaking overload resolution priority.</li>
<li>Clang began choosing the conversion function over the constructor since
version 6.0.0, which was released in 2018, as long as the language mode is set
to C++17 or higher. See commit <code>67ef14</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's
possible for the Clang/GCC behavior to cause problems for users who expect
direct-initialization to always call a constructor. They might try to implement
the conversion function as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Dog::operator Cat() {
    return Cat(*this);  // OK in current C++ and MSVC; infinite recursion in Clang and GCC
}</code></pre>
<p>Either the constructor or the conversion function might be instantiated from
a template rather than written directly to convert to/from a single type;
typically, the constructor.
For this reason, Clang's tie-breaker rule of preferring a
constructor over a conversion function had to be moved ahead of the template
tie-breakers (otherwise, a non-template conversion function would win over a constructor template and would call itself
recursively); see commit <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/5173136a968547330ab5a25c467b9b968be9ab43"><code>5173136</code></a>. Even still, if the constructor
template takes its argument by const reference and the conversion function is
not const-qualified, the conversion function will win like in Example 4.</p>

<p>At the March 3, 2023 CWG telecon, some implementers expressed concerns over
changing the behavior of Example 4, citing domains in which having both a
constructor and a conversion function like in Example 4 are actually common. The
consensus was that the behavior of Example 4 should not be changed, which rules
out the current Clang and GCC approaches.</p>

<p>A related implementation divergence between Clang/GCC and MSVC that was
reported on Stack Overflow involves a binding of a base class reference to a
derived class object, and can be illustrated as follows:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>struct A1 {};

struct A2 {
    A2(const A1&amp;);  // MSVC calls this (conforms to current standard)
    A2(const A2&amp;);
};

struct B : A1 {
    operator A2();  // Clang and GCC call this
};

A2 a(B{});</code></pre>

<h3>Conversion functions to both <code>A</code> and <q>reference to
<code>A</code></q></h3>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>struct T {
    T(T const&amp;);
};

struct S {
    operator T();
    operator T&amp;();
};

S s;
T t(s);</code></pre>
<p>The status quo is this will call <code>S::operator&nbsp;T&amp;</code> because
the implicit conversion from <code>S</code> to <code>T&nbsp;const&amp;</code>
prefers to bind the reference to an lvalue rather than materializing a
temporary (<a href="https://eel.is/c++draft/dcl.init.ref#5.1.2">[dcl.init.ref]/5.1.2</a>).
MSVC and GCC both retain this behavior; Clang's approach of treating
<code>S::operator&nbsp;T</code> as a separate top-level candidate results in it
winning, and <code>S::operator&nbsp;T&amp;</code> is not used.</p>

<p>My feeling is that people who write this kind of code are asking for trouble;
having both <code>operator&nbsp;const&nbsp;T&amp;</code> and
<code>operator&nbsp;T&amp;&amp;</code> in the same class would be fine (sort of
like how we often overload on such pairs of types) but having one return by
reference and the other by value should be expected to cause difficulties. If
we end up changing the behavior of code like this in order to make the more
common cases work properly, the amount of breakage it would cause is likely to
be limited. Nevertheless, this example is based on a real Stack Overflow
question, so I felt it was worth mentioning.</p>

<h3>Hypothetical examples where Clang/GCC might introduce new
ambiguities</h3>
<p>There were no reported cases on Stack Overflow where Clang's approach
introduced an ambiguity that is not present in the current standard. However, it
is possible to construct one by having multiple conversion functions that take
precedence over all constructors but are ambiguous among themselves:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>struct Y;

struct X {
    X(const Y&amp;);
};

struct A {
    operator X();
};

struct B {
    operator X();
};

struct Y : A, B { };

X x(Y{});  // well-formed in current C++, ambiguous in Clang</code></pre>
<p>My sense is that the amount of real code that would exhibit this kind of
breakage is low, although there are approaches we could take to avoid them if
CWG considers it important to do so.
It was also pointed out on the reflector that users who would encounter such an
ambiguity as a result of adopting the Clang approach would have an easy fix:
add the constructor <code>X::X(Y&amp;&amp;)</code>.</p>

<p>I don't think GCC's algorithm ever introduces new ambiguities. In cases like
the above where it is ambiguous which conversion function would be used in order
to call the copy/move constructor of the destination class, the overload
resolution priority of that constructor is unaffected relative to the status
quo; in the specific example above, that means the move constructor of
<code>X</code> loses in overload resolution, just as in the status quo. If GCC
does decide to replace one or more copy/move constructors with a conversion
function for the purposes of overload resolution, then all such constructors
will use the same conversion function since the reference binding in all cases
will use
<a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/dcl.init.ref#5.4.1">[dcl.init.ref]/5.4.1</a>.
If that conversion function wins the top-level overload resolution, it is called
(there is no need to pick one of the copy/move constructors that originally
required it, since the constructor wouldn't be called anyway). The conversion
function will never be ambiguous relative to another constructor, because
constructors are preferred over conversion functions in case of a tie.</p>

<h3>Philosophical difference between Clang and GCC</h3>
<p>The Clang approach makes direct-initialization conceptually more similar to
copy-initialization in that constructors and conversion functions are both
considered when enumerating candidates. This might be viewed as a simplification
of the language (although not one that is particularly likely to result in a
simplification of the wording). The GCC approach preserves the current
philosophy in which constructors are primary for direct-initialization; a
conversion function only gets considered if it chosen by a constructor. This
difference is not just philosophical; in addition to the divergences already
discussed, we can observe that the Clang approach permits copy elision even in
cases where there's no copy constructor at all, not even a deleted one:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>template &lt;int i = 0&gt;
class NonCopyable {
  public:
    NonCopyable(const NonCopyable&amp;) requires(i != 0);

  private:
    NonCopyable(int x);
    friend struct Source;
};

struct Source {
    operator NonCopyable&lt;0&gt;();
};

NonCopyable&lt;0&gt; nc(Source{});  // OK in Clang; ill-formed in GCC, MSVC, and the current standard</code></pre>

<p>In the March 3, 2023 telecon, CWG appeared to be divided as to how this
example should behave. It was pointed out that in current C++, this
initialization is well-formed as a copy-initialization, and some members
expressed dissatisfaction that it does not also work as a direct-initialization.
Others pointed out that the direct-initialization syntax looks as if it connotes
a constructor call, and while we all agree that we intend to elide that call
under some circumstances (see Example 1), perhaps we should not actually be
trying to support Example 8.</p>

<h2>Proposed resolution</h2>
<p>After the CWG telecon on March 3, 2023, and in particular the consensus to
continue calling the constructor in Example 4, a number of different feasible
approaches still remain. One is to simply adopt the MSVC approach, which is
guaranteed to have no effect on overload resolution. A second is the MSVC
approach plus a small fix for Example 8, namely: only if there is no viable
constructor for the direct-initialization, consider conversion functions. A
third approach, which preserves the behavior of Examples 4 and 5 while retaining
the Clang/GCC changes for Examples 2 and 3 and the Clang changes for Example 8,
is to
place
constructors and conversion functions into separate <q>brackets</q> for the
overload resolution tournament; in the championship match, a constructor using a
standard conversion sequence beats any conversion function.</p>

<p>I lean toward the third
approach. In any case, the resolution should also cover the (very similar) case where an
object of class type is list-initialized from an initializer list with a single
element of class type.</p>
